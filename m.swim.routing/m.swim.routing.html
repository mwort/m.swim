<h2>DESCRIPTION<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></h2>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">m.swim.routing</span> module
computes the routing structure for a given subbasin vector and
accumulation raster map that are produced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">m.swim.subbasins</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">r.watershed</span>. A column named 'nextID'
denoting the next downstream subbasin IDs is uploaded to the subbasin
table which is then used to produce the SWIM routing (.fig) file. In
addition, the module produces a routing network vector map, a
mainstream vector and raster map, subbasin outlet and inlet point
vector maps (all map have default output names or can be set) and it
uploads an additional column to the subbasin table named 'inletID'
mapping the subbasin to an appropriate inlet. The additional output is
mainly useful for visualising the routing structure, while the
mainstream raster map is needed for the subsequent <span style="font-weight: bold;">m.swim.substats</span> module.<br>
<br>
<h3>Verifying the routing structure</h3>
Although the module can produce both the 'nextID' column and the SWIM
routing file in one execution, the recommended work flow is to first
produce the routing structure (from-to subbasin IDs) and the additional
maps, then (visually) examine the results using the created <span style="font-weight: bold;">routingnetwork</span> and possibly make manual
adjustments, and only then write the SWIM routing file with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-r</span> flag set (see examples). If the
subbasin map was produced with the same accumulation map and in the
same resolution/region, then the routing structure is expected to be
exact and reflecting the river network as shown in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">mainstreams</span> map. The routing network
vector visualises the routing and either just shows the connections
between the outlets and inlets (default) or the lines from centroids to
the outlet and inlet using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">-c</span>
flag. Although the routing can be manually changed by either changing
the subbasin IDs in the nextID column of the subbasin vector or by
using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">fromto</span> argument, it
is recommended to make sure the same accumulation map was used to
produce the subbasins or to 'burn' a more accurate river network into
the DEM and then remake the accumulation map using r.watershed (!with
the -s flag!).<br>
<em></em>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
It is highly recommended to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
same accumulation map as was used to produce the subbasin map</span>
(in the same resolution and grass region)!!! If this condition is not
met, inexact routing and multiple outlet subbasins are highly likely.<br>

If you have not produced the accumulation raster with m.swim.subbasin, make sure it has the data type CELL and has no minus values in the catchment of interest. The best way to ensure thatis to run:<br>
<pre>r.mapcalc exp="accumulation_correct=if(accumulation_incorrect > 0,int(accumulation_incorrect), null())"</pre>

If you are using predefined subbasins that are split over multiple parts (they really should't, but assuming you have a valid reason for it), the routingnet can not be created and the argument must be set to none (routingnet=''). This does not affect the .fig file.

Although this module has been tested, it is still in beta mode and
hasn't been extensively error coded. Please report unexplained errors
to the author (see below).<br>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
Setting up a SWIM project in the North Carolina (basic) testing
location:<br>
<br>
Create a new mapset and set region:
<pre>g.mapset -c mapset=subbasins<br>g.region rast=elevation@PERMANENT<br></pre>
<h3>Stations</h3>
Create a stations point vector map:<br>
<pre>echo "x|y|name|subbsize<br>640579|215607|outlet|0.1<br>640388|216617|headwater|0.05" &gt; stations.dat<br>v.in.ascii input=stations.dat out=stations x=1 y=2 columns='x int, y int, name varchar(20), subbsize double' skip=1</pre>
<h3>Subbasins</h3>
Make subbasins (default output arguments):
<pre>m.swim.subbasins elevation=elevation@PERMANENT stations=stations upthresh=0.1 subbasins=subbasins</pre>
In addition to the subbasins vector and raster map, this also produces
catchment raster and vector maps, accumulation, drainage, streams,
slopesteepness and slopelength rasters (as needed by the subsequent
m.swim.* modules) by default.<br>
<h3>Routing</h3>
Calculate the routing structure, routing network and mainstreams (the
output defaults are: mainstreams=mainstreams,
routingnet=routingnetwork, outlets=subbasinoutlets,
inlets=subbasininlets; which can also be set explicitly):<br>
<pre><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>m.swim.routing subbasins=subbasins accumulation=accumulation<br></pre>
Or set the -c flag to include the centroids in the routing network:<br>
<pre><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>m.swim.routing -c subbasins=subbasins accumulation=accumulation<br></pre>

Check routing structure and write SWIM routing file (the --o overwrite
is necessary as the mainstreams are recreated):<br>
<pre>m.swim.routing -r subbasins=subbasins figpath=mypro.fig --o<br></pre>
Both these steps can also be executed at once (but may result in an
error if the there are too many outlets):<br>
<pre>m.swim.routing subbasins=subbasins accumulation=accumulation figpath=mypro.fig</pre>
