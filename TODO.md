Improvements
============
## m.swim.subbasins
- tidy clean_subbasins method, maybe move some to postprocess_subbasins
- convert accumulation cells to km2 and remove all kmtocell/celltokm conversions,
  possible with routing?

## m.swim.substats
- provide additional files, eg. subcatch, bsn etc.

## m.swim.hydrotopes
- soils need to be in sequential order
