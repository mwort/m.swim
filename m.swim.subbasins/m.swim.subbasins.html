<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>The m.swim.subbasins module provides flexible interface to the r.watershed
module allowing the delineation of subbasins within a specified
subbasin size range, constraining them to any amount gauging stations
as well as including predefined subbasins and the production of rich
ancillary maps and subbasin information (provided in the subbasins
vector table). The module works in two steps:<br>

<ul>

<li>It first calculates the accumulation, drainage and streams for the entire region. This step can be skipped by setting the -d flag
to save time when recalculating the subbasins, but the accumulation,
drainage and streams raster must exist in that case. This step also
outputs the slope steepness and slope length rasters needed for the m.swim.substats module (names given by default).
  </li>

  <li>Then it calculates the catchments and subbasins for each station given in stations, cleans the subbasin maps and produces the additional subbasin information and outputs the subbasin statistics to stdout.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Subbasin size thresholds</h3>
The upper subbasin size threshold given either for all catchments in upthresh or for each station's catchment individually by reading the station's column given in upthreshcolumn
is a soft limit, i.e. it may exceed this and should be more considered
a mean subbasin size, as it is mostly underestimated (see the
r.watershed manual for more details). The lothresh argument, however, is a hard lower limit, i.e. no subbasins smaller than this should exist in the resultant subbasin map.<br>


<h2>NOTES</h2>Although
this module has been tested, it is still in beta mode and hasn't been
extensively error coded. Please report unexplained errors to the author
(see below).<br>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
Setting up a SWIM project in the North Carolina (basic) testing location:<br>
<br>
Create a new mapset and set region:
<pre>g.mapset -c mapset=subbasins<br>g.region rast=elevation@PERMANENT<br></pre>
<h3>Stations</h3>
Create a stations point vector map:<br>
<pre>echo "x|y|name|subbsize<br>640579|215607|outlet|0.1<br>640388|216617|headwater|0.05" > stations.dat<br>v.in.ascii input=stations.dat out=stations x=1 y=2 columns='x int, y int, name varchar(20), subbsize double' skip=1</pre>
<h3>Subbasins</h3>
Make simple subbasins (default output arguments):
<pre>m.swim.subbasins elevation=elevation@PERMANENT stations=stations upthresh=0.1 subbasins=subbasins<br></pre>

In
addition to the subbasins vector and raster map, this also produces
catchment raster and vector maps, accumulation, drainage, streams,
slopesteepness and slopelength rasters (as needed by the subsequent
m.swim.* modules) by default.<br>

Subbasins with varying subbasin thresholds and defined lower threshold:<br>
<pre>m.swim.subbasins elevation=elevation@PERMANENT stations=stations upthreshcolumn=subbsize lothresh=0.001 subbasins=subbasins</pre>
