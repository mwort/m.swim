<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>The m.swim.substats
module creates the SWIM subbasin statistics input files (.sub, .rte,
.gw) and the file.cio file. All parameters maybe given as either
default value for all subbasins or as a raster map for which subbasin
average values are found and written to the files. By using the
drainage, accumulation and mainstreams maps produced by the
m.swim.subbasins and m.swim.routing modules, it can also compute the
main channel length, slope, depth and width. These four parameters are
computed as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Channel length: The
length is approximated from the mainstreams and drainage map and
constrained to be at least one cell size long and not greater as the
subbasins perimeter (this constraint allows for uncertainties in the
mainstreams map).</li>
  <li>Channel slope: The slope is calculated from the elevation raster and then averaged over the mainstreams cells and reported for each subbasin.</li>
  <li>Channel width:
Approximated using the drainage area calculated from the accumulation
map through this empirical relationship (with an upper limit of 3000m):</li>

    <li><em>width[m] = 1.29 * darea[km2] ^ 0.6</em></li>
  <li>: Approximated using the drainage area calculated from the accumulation
map through this empirical relationship (with an upper limit of 50m):</li>

    <li><em>depth[m] = 0.13 * darea[km2] ^ 0.4</em></li>
</ul>
Raster maps with subbasin mean values are created implicitly and the
values are uploaded to the subbasin table with the following names: <em>mainChannelLength, mainChannelSlope, channelDepth, channelWidth</em> This allows a faster recalculation by setting the arguments chl, chs, chd, chw to these names.<br>
<br>
For all other parameters default values are given that apply to all subbasins, except for the USLE slope length and steepness, for which the output of the m.swim.subbasins or r.watershed is used to calculate average values for each subbasin.<br>

<h2>NOTES</h2>All parameter arguments are the same as their variable names in the SWIM code.<br>
<br>
Although
this module has been tested, it is still in beta mode and hasn't been
extensively error coded. Please report unexplained errors to the author
(see below).<br>
<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
Setting up a SWIM project in the North Carolina (basic) testing location:<br>
<br>
Create a new mapset and set region:
<pre>g.mapset -c mapset=subbasins<br>g.region rast=elevation@PERMANENT<br></pre>
<h3>Stations</h3>
Create a stations point vector map:<br>
<pre>echo "640579|215607|outlet|0.1<br>640388|216617|headwater|0.05" &gt; stations.dat<br>v.in.ascii input=stations.dat out=stations x=1 y=2 columns='x int, y int, name varchar(20), subbsize double'</pre>
<h3>Subbasins</h3>
Make subbasins (default output arguments):
<pre>m.swim.subbasins elevation=elevation@PERMANENT stations=stations upthresh=0.1 subbasins=subbasins slopesteepness=slopesteepness slopelength=slopelength</pre>
<br>
In
addition to the subbasins vector and raster map, this also produces
catchment raster and vector maps, accumulation, drainage, streams,
slopesteepness and slopelength rasters (as needed by the subsequent
m.swim.* modules) by default.<br>
<h3>Routing</h3>
Calculate the routing
structure, routing network and mainstreams (the output defaults are:
mainstreams=mainstreams, routingnet=routingnetwork,
outlets=subbasinoutlets, inlets=subbasininlets; which can also be set
explicitly):<br>
<pre>m.swim.routing subbasins=subbasins accumulation=accumulation mainstreams=mainstreams</pre>
<h3>Subbasin statistics</h3>Create the subbasin statistics files in a Sub folder and the file.cio in the projectpath
with all default input (mainstreams, drainage, accumulation,&nbsp; stp
and sl also have default values but included here to emphasise that
they are needed as input):<br>
<pre>m.swim.substats subbasins=subbasins projectname=mypro projectpath=. elevation=elevation@PERMANENT \<br>                mainstreams=mainstreams drainage=drainage accumulation=accumulation stp=slopesteepness sl=slopelength</pre>

When recalculating or changing parameters, the calculation can be accelerated by setting chl, chs, chd, chw explicitly:<br>
<pre>m.swim.substats subbasins=subbasins projectname=mypro projectpath=. elevation=elevation@PERMANENT \<br>                delay=geology@PERMANENT chl=mainChannelLength chs=mainChannelSlope chd=channelDepth chw=channelWidth<br></pre>
